# 🧠 Quantum CNN Image Recognition

This repository implements a **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCHCNN)**  
for image recognition using **Qiskit**, **PyTorch**, and **scikit-learn**.

## 🚀 Overview
The model integrates quantum feature maps with classical neural layers  
to explore the potential of quantum-enhanced deep learning.

## 🧩 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Quantum-CNN-Image-Recognition.git
   cd Quantum-CNN-Image-Recognition
